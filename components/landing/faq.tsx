    q: "Do you store or read my email?",
    a: "No. Your email is parsed in your browser and sent only to the AI provider that generates your results. It never reaches our servers, and MiniBrief contains no analytics, telemetry, or behavioral tracking.",

    q: "Which inboxes does it support?",
    a: "Gmail and Outlook, both available now. The panel runs inside your existing webmail — there is no separate app to open.",

    a: "No. MiniBrief works with a built-in model from the moment you sign in. Power users can optionally add their own Anthropic API key in Settings, but it is not required.",
