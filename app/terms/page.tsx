        <p>
          MiniBrief is an AI-powered browser extension that reads your Gmail and
          Outlook email, together with your Google Calendar, and uses AI to
          generate summaries, meeting briefs, action items, and triage. We may
          add, change, or remove features over time.

        <h2>6. AI-generated content</h2>
        <p>
          Summaries, briefs, action items, and triage categories are generated
          by AI and may be incomplete or inaccurate. They are meant to assist
          you, not replace your own review. Do not rely on AI output for
          decisions requiring accuracy without checking the underlying messages
          yourself.

      <section>
        <h2>7. Fair use</h2>
        <p>
          To keep the Service reliable and affordable for everyone, AI features
          are subject to a fair-use limit of 120 AI requests per user per day.
          We may adjust this limit, and we may throttle, suspend, or limit
          accounts that materially exceed normal individual use or that attempt
          to circumvent the limit.

          will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or

          arising from your use of or inability to use MiniBrief. Our total

          You may stop using MiniBrief and disconnect your accounts at any time.
          We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these terms or to
          protect the service or other users. Sections that by their nature
          should survive termination (intellectual property, disclaimers,
          limitation of liability, indemnification, dispute resolution, and the
          general terms below) will continue to apply.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>14. Governing law</h2>
        <p>
          These terms are governed by the laws of the State of New York, United
          States, without regard to its conflict-of-laws rules. Subject to the
          dispute-resolution section below, any disputes will be resolved in the
          state and federal courts located in the State of New York, unless
          applicable law requires otherwise.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>15. Dispute resolution; arbitration and class-action waiver</h2>
        <p>
          <em>
            Please read this section carefully — it affects how disputes are
            resolved and limits your right to sue in court or participate in a
            class action.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Except as set out below, you and MiniBrief agree to resolve any
          dispute arising out of or relating to these terms or MiniBrief through
          final and binding individual arbitration, rather than in court,
          governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. You and MiniBrief waive any
          right to a jury trial and agree that disputes will be brought only in
          an individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any
          class, consolidated, or representative proceeding.
        </p>
        <p>
          This does not apply to: claims that qualify for small-claims court, or
          requests for injunctive or equitable relief to stop infringement or
          misuse of intellectual property. You may opt out of this arbitration
          agreement by emailing{" "}
          <a href="mailto:legal@minibrief.app">legal@minibrief.app</a> within 30
          days of first accepting these terms; opting out will not affect the
          other terms. Where applicable law prohibits binding arbitration or a
          class-action waiver, this section does not apply to you to that
          extent.

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>16. General</h2>
        <p>
          These terms, together with our{" "}
          <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, are the entire agreement
          between you and MiniBrief and supersede any prior understandings. If
          any provision is found unenforceable, the rest will remain in full
          force, and the unenforceable provision will be applied to the maximum
          extent permitted. Our failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver
          of it. You may not assign or transfer these terms without our consent;
          we may assign them, for example as part of a merger, acquisition, or
          sale of assets, with notice to you.

        <h2>17. Changes and contact</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these terms as the product develops; the &ldquo;Last
          updated&rdquo; date above will change accordingly. Questions can be
