          rely on assistive technology. We are working toward conformance with

        <ul>
          <li>Semantic HTML structure with a logical heading order and landmark regions.</li>
          <li>Full keyboard operability, with visible focus indicators on interactive elements.</li>
          <li>Respect for the operating system &ldquo;reduce motion&rdquo; setting — animations are minimized or removed when it is enabled.</li>
          <li>Restrained, low-motion visual design with attention to text color contrast.</li>
          <li>Text alternatives for meaningful images and descriptive labels for controls.</li>

          This is a pre-launch site under active development. The animated
          product preview is illustrative and primarily decorative; the
          information it shows is also described in the surrounding text. If
          you encounter any element that is difficult to use, we want to hear
          about it.
